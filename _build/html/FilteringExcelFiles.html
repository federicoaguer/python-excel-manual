<h1>Filtering Excel Files<a class="headerlink" href="#filtering-excel-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Any examples shown below can be found in the
xlutils
directory of the course material.</p>
<div class="section" id="other-utilities-in-xlutils">
<h2>Other utilities in xlutils<a class="headerlink" href="#other-utilities-in-xlutils" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The
xlutils
package contains several utilities in addition to those for filtering. The following are often useful:</p>
<div class="section" id="xlutils-styles">
<h3>xlutils.styles<a class="headerlink" href="#xlutils-styles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This module contains one class which, when instantiated with an
xlrd.Workbook
, will let you discover the style name and information from a given cell in that workbook as shown in the following example:</p>
<p>NB: For obvious reasons,
open_workbook
must be called with
formatting_info=True
in order to use
xlutils.styles
.</p>
<p>Full documentation and examples can be found in the
styles.txt
file in the docs folder of
xlutils
&#8216; source distribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="xlutils-display">
<h3>xlutils.display<a class="headerlink" href="#xlutils-display" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This module contains utility functions for easy and safe display of information returned by xlrd.</p>
<p>quoted_sheet_name
is called with the
name
attribute of an
xlrd.sheet.Sheet
instance and will return an encoded string containing a quoted version of the sheet&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>cell_display
is called with an
xlrd.sheet.Cell
instance and returns an encoded string containing a sensible representation of the cells contents, even for Date and Error cells. If a date cell is to be displayed,
cell_display</p>
<p>must
be called with the
datemode
attribute of the
xlrd.Book
from which the cell came.</p>
<p>The following examples show both functions in action:</p>
<p>Full documentation and examples can be found in the display.txt file in the docs folder of xlutils&#8217; source distribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="xlutils-copy">
<h3>xlutils.copy<a class="headerlink" href="#xlutils-copy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This module contains one function that will take an
xlrd.Book
and returns an
xlwt.Workbook
populated with the data and formatting found in the
xlrd.Book
.</p>
<p>This is extremely useful for updating an existing spreadsheet as the following example shows:</p>
<p>It is important to note that some things won&#8217;t be copied:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Formulae</li>
<li>Names</li>
<li>anything ignored by xlrd</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the modules described above, there are also
xlutils.margins
and
xlutils.save
, but these are only useful in certain situations. Refer to their documentation in the
xlutils
source distribution.</p>

<div class="section" id="structure-of-xlutils-filter">
<h2>Structure of xlutils.filter<a class="headerlink" href="#structure-of-xlutils-filter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This framework is designed to filter and split Excel files using a series of modular readers, filters and writers as shown in the diagram below:</p>
<p><img alt="Object_1_png" src="_images/Object_11.png" /></p>
<p>The flow of information between the components is by method calls on the next component in the chain. The possible method calls are listed in the table below, where
rdbook
is an
xlrd.Book
instance,
rdsheet
is an
xlrd.sheet.Sheet
instance,
rdrowx
,
rdcolx
,
wtrowx
and
wtcolx
and integer indexes specifying the cell to read from and write to,
wtbook_name
is a string specifying the name of the Excel file to write to and
wtsheet_name
is a
unicode
specifying the name of the sheet to write to:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="17%" />
<col width="83%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>start()</td>
<td><p class="first">This method is called before processing of a batch of input. It can be called at any time. One common use is to reset all the filters in a chain in the event of an error</p>
<p class="last">during the processing of an rdbook.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>workbook(rdbook,wtbook_name)</td>
<td>This method is called every time processing of a new workbook starts</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>sheet(rdsheet,wtsheet_name)</td>
<td>This method is called every time processing of a new sheet in the current workbook starts</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>set_rdsheet(rdsheet)</td>
<td>This method is called to indicate a change for the source of cells mid-way through writing a sheet.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>row(rdrowx,wtrowx)</td>
<td>The row method is called every time processing of a new row in the current sheet starts.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>cell(rdrowx,rdcolx,wtrowx,wtcolx)</td>
<td>This is called for every cell in the sheet being processed. This is the most common method in which filtering and queuing of onward calls to the next component takes place.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>finish</td>
<td>This method is called once processing of all workbooks has been completed.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="section" id="readers">
<h3>Readers<a class="headerlink" href="#readers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A reader&#8217;s job is to obtain one or more
xlrd.Book
objects and iterate over those objects issuing appropriate calls to the next component in the chain. The order of calling is expected to be as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>start<ul>
<li>workbook
, once for each
xlrd.Book
object obtained<ul>
<li>sheet
, once for each sheet found in the current book</li>
<li>set_rdsheet
, whenever the sheet from which cells to be read needs to be changed. This method may not be called between calls to
row
and
cell
, and between multiple calls to
cell
. It may only be called once all
cell
calls for a row have been made.<ul>
<li>row
, once for each row in the current sheet<ul>
<li>cell
, once for each cell in the row</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>finish
, once all
xlrd.Book
objects have been processed</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, for method calls made by a reader, the following should be true:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>wtbook_name
should be the filename of the file the
xlrd.Book
object originated from.</li>
<li>wtsheet_name
should be
rdbook.name</li>
<li>wtrowx
should be equal to
rdrowx</li>
<li>rdcolx
should be equal to
wtcolx</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these restrictions, an
xlutils.filter.BaseReader
class is provided that will normally only need to have one of two methods overridden to get any required functionality:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>get_filepaths
– if implemented, this must return an iterable sequence of paths to excel files that can be opened with python&#8217;s builtin file.</li>
<li>get_workbooks
– if implemented, this must return an sequence of 2-tuples. Each tuple must contain an
xlrd.Book
object followed by a string containing the filename of the file from which the
xlrd.Book
object was loaded.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="filters">
<h3>Filters<a class="headerlink" href="#filters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Implementing these components is where the bulk of the work will be done by users of the
xlutils.filter
framework. A Filter&#8217;s responsibilities are to accept method calls from the preceding component in the chain, do any processing necessary and then emit appropriate method calls to the next component in the chain.</p>
<p>There is very little constraint on what order Filters receive and emit method calls other than that the order of method calls emitted must remain consistent with the structure given above. This enables components to be freely interchanged more easily.</p>
<p>Because Filters may only need to implement few of the full set of method calls, an
xlutils.filter.BaseFilter
is provided that does nothing but pass the method calls on to the next component in the chain. The implementation of this filter is useful to see when embarking on Filter implementation:</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writers">
<h3>Writers<a class="headerlink" href="#writers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>These components do the grunt work of actually copying the appropriate information from the
rdbook
and serialising it into an Excel file. This is a complicated process and not for the feint of hard to re-implement.</p>
<p>For this reason, an
xlutils.filter.BaseWriter
component is provided that does all of the hard work and has one method that needs to be implemented. That method is
get_stream
and it is called with the filename of the Excel file to be written. Implementations of this method are expected to return a new file-like object that has a
write
and, by default, a
close
method each time they are called.</p>
<p>Subclasses may also override the boolean
close_after_write
attribute, which is
True
by default, to indicate that the file-like objects returned from
get_stream
should not have their
close
method called once serialisation of the Excel file data is complete.</p>
<p>It is important to note that some things won&#8217;t be copied from the
rdbook
by
BaseWriter
:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Formulae</li>
<li>Names</li>
<li>anything ignored by xlrd</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="process">
<h3>Process<a class="headerlink" href="#process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The process function is responsible for taking a series of components as its arguments. The first of these should be a Reader. The last of these should be a Writer. The rest should be the necessary Filters in the order of processing required.</p>
<p>The process method will wire these components together by way of their
next
attributes and then kick the process off by calling the Reader and passing the first Filter in the chain as its argument.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-worked-example">
<h2>A worked example<a class="headerlink" href="#a-worked-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we want to filter an existing Excel file to omit rows that have an X in the first column.</p>
<p>The following example shows possible components to do this and shows how they would be instantiated and called to achieve this:</p>
<p>In reality, we would not need to implement the Reader and Writer components, as there are already suitable components included.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="existing-components">
<h2>Existing components<a class="headerlink" href="#existing-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The xlutils.filter framework comes with a wide range of existing components, each of which is briefly described below. For full descriptions and worked examples of all these components, please see
filter.txt
in the
docs
folder of the
xlutils
source distribution.</p>
<div class="section" id="globreader">
<h3>GlobReader<a class="headerlink" href="#globreader" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re processing files that are on disk, then this is probably the reader for you. It returns all files matching the path specification it&#8217;s instantiated with.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="xlrdreader">
<h3>XLRDReader<a class="headerlink" href="#xlrdreader" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This reader can be used at the start of a chain when you already have an
xlrd.Book
object and you&#8217;ll looking to process it with
xlutils.filter
.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testreader">
<h3>TestReader<a class="headerlink" href="#testreader" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This reader is specifically designed for testing filterimplementations with known sets of cells.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="directorywriter">
<h3>DirectoryWriter<a class="headerlink" href="#directorywriter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you want files you&#8217;re processing to end up on disk, then this is probably the writer for you. It stores files in the directory it is instantiated with.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="streamwriter">
<h3>StreamWriter<a class="headerlink" href="#streamwriter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you want to write exactly one workbook to a stream, such as a
tempfile.TemporaryFile
or
sys.stdout
, then this is the writer for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="xlwtwriter">
<h3>XLWTWriter<a class="headerlink" href="#xlwtwriter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you want to change cells after the filtering process is complete then this writer can be used to obtain the
xlwt.Workbook
objects that BaseWriter generates.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="columntrimmer">
<h3>ColumnTrimmer<a class="headerlink" href="#columntrimmer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This filter will strip columns containing no useful data from the end of sheets. The definition of “no useful data” can be controlled during instantiation of this filter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="errorfilter">
<h3>ErrorFilter<a class="headerlink" href="#errorfilter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This filter caches all method calls in a file on disk and will only pass them on the next component in the chain when its
finish
method has been called
and
no error messages have been logged to the python logging framework.</p>
<p>If Boolean or error Cells are encountered, an error message will be logged to the python logging framework will will also usually mean that no methods will be emitted from this component to the next component in the chain.</p>
<p>Finally,
cell
method calls corresponding to Empty cells in
rdsheet
will not be passed on to the next component in the chain.</p>
<p>Calling this component&#8217;s
start
method will reset it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="echo">
<h3>Echo<a class="headerlink" href="#echo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This filter will print calls to the methods configured when the filter is instantiated along with the arguments passed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="memorylogger">
<h3>MemoryLogger<a class="headerlink" href="#memorylogger" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This filter will dump stats to the path it was configured with using the heapy package if it is available. If it is not available, no operations are performed.</p>
